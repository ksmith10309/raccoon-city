## PROJECT PITCH:
This project is to simulate the economic constraints that a user could face living in a big city like Seattle. On the web page, we will display eight necessities for a user to choose; they are essential needs such as food, clothing, housing, health insurance, etc. However, the user is able to choose only five of them. Upon submit, the user will be brought to the result page which summarizes the result of their choices.

## GROUP AGREEMENT:
Our safeword is "pineapple" and we will take a five-minute break upon a group member's request. 
Whenever a member wants to make a pull request to the master and do a merge, the other three members have to review and agree. Once the merge is done, the other three members will immediately do a git pull origin master to update their local working directory.
